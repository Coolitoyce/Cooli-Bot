# CooliBot

CooliBot is your average multifunctional Discord bot, built using `discord.py`.
This bot showcases my learning journey with the library. It features custom prefixes, hybrid commands, basic moderation tools, utility and fun commands, rich context menu interactions, and even game info lookup.
